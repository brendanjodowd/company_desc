Artinmotion have a wide range of colours from matt, gloss, pearl, metallic, carbon etc so now you can change the colour of your car anytime you want. Car wrapping also protects your paintwork from fading, scores and marks. It is easily removed when you come to sell your car if need be. Vehicle Graphics From a single vehicle to an entire fleet, professionally designed and applied graphics notonly raise the profile of your business, they are also one of the most effective forms of advertising. Reflective vinyl images can bring a vehicle to life at dusk or through the night. This can be not only advantageous for promotional purposes but an important safety consideration. On average, a busy vehicle can be seen by more than 3,000 people every hour. Window Graphics To comply with Health and Safety regulations, large areas of glass have to be marked in some description to prevent accidental collision - but they also offer the opportunity for elegant and high-impact corporate and promotional messages. The way in which glass is marked can create not only visually stunning and eye-catching signage, it can also say much about your company and your business. Using the latest advanced films, the illusion of etched or frosted glass can be created at a fraction of the cost. Banners & Display Stands Artinmotion can create all types of banners from drapes to mounted banners on stands which are consequently portable and therefore ideal for use at exhibitions or in retail locations.Using frames to mount a banner not only helps to prolong the life of a sign, it leads to a variety of fixing alternatives.Mounted banners can be used in conjunction with banner track and suspension systems for use internally or externally - keeping the banner and the message effective in even the worst weather conditions.",print

Modern day processes have revolutionised the company but the dedication to integrity, quality and service has been carried forward. 2016 As the company evolves, the 'signsystems' part of the original logo becomes perceived as being a little restrictive, in that the offering extends beyond this to products such as Glass Features, Lighting and other bespoke solutions. Following input from industry-leading brand consultants, some subtle tweaks are implemented. The company will continue to build the 'ascot' brand which has already achieved widespread recognition, along with a new associated distinctive icon that draws in the organisation's strong trading history since 1938. The new logo is accompanied by a summative strapline 'inspired signage and architectural creations'. 2016 Ascot expands the Operations team, with new Design Technicians, Production and Installation operatives joining to help service steadily increasing workstream. 2015 Steady growth and highly successful project delivery throughout UK and Ireland continued in 2015, thanks to a great team pulling together to achieve strong performance at every level of the organisation. 2014 The company continues to build a strong track record of highly satisfied clients, carrying forward the core values of quality and integrity. 2013 In house Project Design team created, to provide our clients with a further value-added service. 2012 100 years since M.

98,"The company was established in January 1993, by Ken Magee and Alister Browne. With a base at Ballycastle Road Industrial Estate, Coleraine, they aimed to use their experience in the electrical industry to take on the multinationals by offering an unrivalled level of quality service and dedication, showing customers ""the personal touch"", coupled with extensive levels of stock and efficient delivery schedules. Operating out of a 5000 square foot warehouse in Coleraine, and with 3 personnel and one delivery van, the company commenced trading. It was a big undertaking, but 19 years on, they have built on the initial foundations, adding two additional branches and becoming one of the province's most successful independent electrical wholesalers. It was clear from the start that the customer-driven ethos struck a cord with the electrical trade. The two founder's vision was obviously welcomed by customers as, after just a year in business, the company expanded at a rapid rate, with more staff, product ranges and delivery routes being added. A second branch was opened in Ballymena in 1999, a move that not only highlighted the company's growing success, but also reflected their desire to better meet customer needs.As BM Electrical has grown, so has their reputation. After initially serving the Coleraine area, their service quickly expanded to take in large parts of County Antrim as well as neighbouring Tyrone and Londonderry. In addition, the company has also worked with clients in both the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain. In February 2008, the company expansion continued, with the opening of the third branch in Londonderry. The new branch will support existing customers in this area, and enable the company to expand with new business and customers. With a varied customer base, including electricians, electrical contractors, industrial and commercial engineers, Health, Education and Government, alarm and CCTV installers, factories, hotels, retailers and many others, the company will continue to grow from strength to strength. Thanks to a state-of-the-art computer system running specialist distribution software, which links the three branches, we are able to control our stock levels very closely, while a recent investment in a new telephone system has greatly improved the efficiency of sales calls. With a total of 30,000 square feet of warehouse space, stock levels in excess of £800,000, a staff of 24, a fleet of 5 delivery vans and a wealth of experience, the company continues to be one of the provinces leading electrical wholesalers. Buying power! BM Electrical Wholesale Ltd. is a member of the AWEBB Buying Group. With over 60 members, AWEBB is one of the largest electrical buying groups in the UK. AWEBB negotiate buying deals on behalf its members, and also support its members with a bulk distribution centre based in Derbyshire.

By being a member, BM Electrical can combine their buying power with other independent electrical wholesalers, to get the best deals from suppliers and offer competitive prices and efficient service to their customers.

Philip has three degrees, including a PhD in hydraulics, has published several journal and conference papers and is a Chartered Member of both Engineers Ireland and the Institution of Civil Engineers. He has over 20 year experience in flooding and has worked with OPW and Rivers Agency on numerous large scale flood alleviation schemes across the country.

We will meet your deadline, working into the small hours if necessary and we genuinely care about each project we work on.

We are unique because we offer a personal design service where all our houses are designed specifically to suit your lifestyle, dreams and location. Being a small practice, dedicated to creating stunning homes for our clients, you will work closely with one of our Architects who will be involved with you from inception to completion.

This has helped me understand the dreams, excitement AND fears associated with building your own home. Designing and building your own home is a fun and exciting process. The end result enhanced my lifestyle and gave me something to be proud of. At this stage you probably have lots of questions and anxieties starting the process.

Hi, I'm Ryan and I have been part of the team here at HBK Architects for 16 years. Why do I love what I do? Simple - I love being creative. As a child I always spent hours drawing. Art & Design was my favourite subject in school. Outside the office my main hobby is playing drums in my band, we are always creating new music to record and perform live. I love starting with a dream and turning it into something I can say 'Wow, I did that!' Being an Architect allows me to create everyday. I get to take my client's dreams and help guide them towards that feeling of 'Wow!'. Like Stephen, I have also designed and started to build my own family home.

358,"The two sides of the JL Goor business are over thirty years supplying the Irish Polymer market with machinery, equipment and polymer materials. By working together closely, our aim as JL Goor is to offer a total solution - equipment and materials - to our customers. The machinery business was the start. As the fledgling Irish polymer processing industry took-off in the early 1980's so did the JL Goor business, with John Goor building a portfolio of equipment to offer. As the business grew John was approached by some customers to find out if he could help them with some polymer sourcing problems. The next stage was to begin building up some polymer expertise and to further strengthen the machinery side. Louis Goor joined his father on the machinery side and Gearoid Clarke, with his Polymer Science background provided the polymer know-how. As polymer sales grew it was decided to form a sister company - JL Goor Materials, to focus exclusively on this area. Over the years both companies have continued to grow and develop. Today both companies work very closely together and use their unique position in the Irish Polymer market to provide creative solutions for our customers.",industry

370,"We have been designing, developing and delivering PLC control systems since 2005. Over the past 11 years we have delivered numerous high profile PLC/Scada projects throughout the UK, Europe and Asia. Our knowledge base has grown rapidly since 2005 with the PLC division having designed, installed and commissioned large scale control systems based on both Rockwell/Allen Bradley and Schneider solutions tailored to suit the customer's requirements. With specifications detailing the latest in hardware and functional descriptions looking for optimal performance K-Tec has proven we can deliver these systems on time, on budget, and exceed customer expectations. These PLC systems are usually stand alone, which run on a specified technical TCP/IP network to communicate to a Scada Head End, HMI's (Human Machine Interfaces), Remote I/O and field devices such as power meters, relays and trip units. This communication is aided by utilising managed core switches connected via singlemode and multimode fibres on a turbo ring protocol, which in turn communicate to unmanaged edge switches mounted within the electrical panels or project specific remote interface cabinets. From the edge switches we communicate to field devices via cat 6. Depending on the project, in addition to meters monitoring outgoing supplies we can use modbus cabling connected directly to the breakers to provide an additional method of monitoring and provide system redundancy. Most systems are based on a Hot Standby PLC setup complete with distributed remote I/O stations. We have installed dual redundant supervisor servers running an associated Scada system c/w a database/communication management system. Our systems have been mainly utilised in HV/LV distribution. The Scada headend and HMI's provide the operator with visibility and control of the entire distribution network. The PLC systems reconfigure the distribution network based on mains and generator failure scenarios, breaker failures, load capability etc. The PLC system reconfigures the network by controlling all main VCB and ACB breakers, MCCB load breakers, generator and UPS system etc. The control is normally designed based on a fixed matrix or live feedback. As part of the design and delivery of the PLC control system we will develop a Functional Design Specification (FDS) complete with a suit of flowcharts which will be discussed and refined along with the client before proceeding to the development stage. During development we will submit a number of documents for signoff to ensure the software meets and is in line with the clients requirements. Once development is complete the software will undergo a series of internal tests before being offered to the client for a witness test. Once signed off the system will be installed and commissioned onsite and will undergo initial setup/configuration, level 3, level 4 and level 5/IST tests before handover. During the lifecycle of the PLC control system design, development and delivery a K-Tec Project Manager will oversee and schedule all works in line with the clients requirements. Once the systems are delivered we offer client training and system support. K-Tec take great pride in the quality of graphical displays and control software that we develop. These are professionally designed bespoke to the end clients requirements ensuring a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing interface. Our PLC systems will in turn provide state of the art site wide monitoring and control which will optimise the efficiency of any project or site where all critical information is readily available on a client headend machine.",electrical

578,"Robert McCabe Senior started business in 1930 by importing corks from Portugal and selling them to the pub trade. He opened his first premises on John Street, Drogheda in 1932 selling paper bags and corks to butchers and retail. In 1970 Robert McCabe Junior joined the business during a very transitional period in the industry. This was a time when plastic high density bags were introduced to the market replacing paper in butchers and grocery shops. In 1971 a fire in the John street premises resulted in the company having to relocate and move to Mell, Drogheda in 1972. The John Street premise was rebuilt and in 1984 the company moved back to its original location. The company then moved to Constitution Hill in 1991 before finally moving to Boyne Business Park in 2005 where the company now resides. The introduction of the tax levy on plastic bags in the early 2000s resulted in an increased demand for paper products. These paper products required more space than plastic which was why a move to a bigger warehouse in Boyne Business Park was imminent. In 2017, Roberts's son Andrew joined the business as a 3rd generation family member and is looking to steer the company towards more environmentally friendly products.",industry

640,"There is no doubt that using drilling and blasting is effective, yet it is relatively dangerous without supervision and specialist knowledge of the types of explosives for different types of rock. It can be costly and often requires permits and specific control measures to be put in place. Hydraulic hammer alternatives address many of these concerns, but are slow, noisy and expensive, plus they come with their own health and safety issues because of vibration. In today's high paced, safety conscious workplace, both of these techniques create major problems. We have developed the solution, providing maximum efficiency and effectiveness in a versatile, cost effective and more importantly, safe product. Our patented Terminator Impact Technology lifts a heavy forged steel weight, creating vacuum pressure, which along with gravity, helps accelerate it onto a custom metal alloy striker pin. The striker pin directs its energy into the rock, before resetting. Unlike conventional hammers, Terminator Impact Hammers do not rely on the carrier to avoid ricocheting. It uses it's own weight to rest on the rock, Shock vibrations are absorbed by our unique buffering system enabling the Terminator Rock Breaker to operate safely, while generating extreme high-energy impacts at a low strike rate.",engineering
